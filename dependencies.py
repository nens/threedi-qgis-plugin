"""Handle dependencies: installation and checking/logging.

See :doc:`linked_external-dependencies_readme`
(``external-dependencies/README.rst``) for a full explanation of the
dependency handling.

``python3 dependencies.py`` runs ``generate_constraints_txt()``: it generates
``constraints.txt``.

:py:func:`ensure_everything_installed()` checks if :py:data:`DEPENDENCIES` are
installed and installs them if needed.

:py:func:`check_importability()` double-checks if everything is importable. It also
logs the locations.

Note that we use *logging* in ``check_importability()`` as we want to have the
result in the logfile. The rest of the module uses ``print()`` statements
because it gets executed before any logging has been configured.

As we're called directly from ``__init__.py``, the imports should be
resticted. No qgis message boxes and so!

    On Windows Qgis comes with a hdf5 version installed. Somewhere between
    Qgis version 3.10.8 and 3.10.12 the HDF5 version got upgraded from HDF5 1.10.4 to
    HDF5 1.10.5.

    This plugin uses the h5py python package, which is built against a specific version
    of HDF5. The Qgis HDF5 version and the HDF5 version of the h5py package must be the
    same, otherwise it will not work. In the external-dependencies folder we supply a
    Windows version of h5py built using HDF5 1.10.4. On pypi a h5py package is available
    built with HDF5 1.10.5.

    The following situations can occur:

                           | QGIS HDF5 1.10.4  | QGIS HDF5 1.10.5
    -----------------------|-------------------|---------------
    h5py build with 1.10.4 | A: Good           | B: Qgis crash
    h5py build with 1.10.5 | C: AttributeError | D: Good

    The different situations are marked A, B, C and D in the table above.

    In situations A and D everything is good and the plugin can be loaded without any
    problems.

    Situations B and C occur when a user upgrades/downgrades their Qgis version when
    the ThreediToolbox is already installed with a specific version of h5py.
    In these cases we also need to upgrade/downgrade the h5py version installed with
    ThreediToolbox.

    In situations B Qgis will crash when trying to import h5py.

    We use the H5pyMarker to mark the installed h5py version. This is because we cannot check the version
    by importing h5py, as Qgis will crash if the HDF5 and h5py binaries do not match.
