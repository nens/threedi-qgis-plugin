1.11.1 (2019-06-17)
-------------------

- Made automated tests on travis-ci.org run much faster (from 8 down to 3
  minutes).

- Added better logging. In qgis, our messages are now visible in the console
  log. Also, a logfile is written (``threedi-qgis-log.txt``), which can be

  sqlite and NetCDf

- Include water balance tool (DeltaresTdiToolbox) in plugin.

- Add fix for ``None`` values in WeirStats calculation (caused by np.nan
  casting to None)

1.2 (2018-05-24)
----------------

- Fix the aggregate find function for realz.


1.1 (2018-05-24)
----------------

- Update new aggregate result name.


1.0 (2018-05-24)
----------------

- pumplines exporter now also ignores first element

- Fix some nasty bugs in ``temp_get_value_by_timestep_nr_impl``: some
  variables (like ``qp``) only have a 1D or 2D component, and the previous
  implementation only returned that component. However, this will cause
  indexing errors, so the behavior is changed such that the method now
  always returns a masked array that is 2D+1D long if no index is passed
  as argument. Furthermore, ``np.zeros`` is changed to ``np.ma.zeros`` in
  the if block when an index is passed, which I think also might have caused
  bugs.

- let netcdf_groundwater get_timeseries return NaN istead of -9999

- improve feedback to user in case of graph tool with v2_pumpstation_view

- Close result selection window when the Escape key is pressed.

- Fix leakage name.

- Implement ``get_timeseries`` for pumplines using the newest threedigrid.

- Fix SetFID error caused by int32.

- try to show more often the object_name in graph widget (instead of 'N/A')

- use gridadmin has_pumpstations in functions get_or_create_pumpline_layer and
  available_subgrid_map_vars

- Progressbar exporting to gridadmin.sqlite starts now at 0%

- Add support for aggregate netcdf in NetcdfDataSourceGroundwater.

- add leakage to subgrid_map variables

- Add support for aggregate netcdf in NetcdfDataSourceGroundwater.

- add leakage to subgrid_map variables

- Update available vars methods using threedigrid for
  NetcdfDataSourceGroundwater.

- Bump threedigrid to 0.2.2.

- Enable threedigrid get_timeseries for result and schematization layers

- Disable the "Calculate statistics?" prompt if there are already csv files
  available.

- Add caching of netcdf data in ``get_values_by_timestemp_nr``.

- Enable PEP8 check in build process; fix remaining PEP8 errors.

- Move icons to ``icons`` folder.

- Wrap layer generation code in transactions to improve performance (it was
  very slow on Windows, this improves it considerably so it's possible that
  it autocommited on every statement, see: http://gdal.org/drv_sqlite.html)

- Update groundwater flowlines overlapping order.

- Title of sideview dockwidget does not overlap with button anymore

- Remask masked arrays in ``get_values_by_timestemp_nr`` for
  NetcdfDataSourceGroundwater.

- Change the geometry column name of ``gridadmin.sqlite`` from ``GEOM`` to
  ``the_geom`` so that it behaves similarly to the old
  ``subgrid_map.sqlite1``. This required the use of the ``Spatialite``
  connector (subclasses QGIS db_plugin) because GDAL versions lower than 2.0
  do not support renaming of geometry columns.

- Make ``disable_sqlite_synchronous`` re-entrant (i.e.: it works expectedly
  when multiple functions that are decorated with it call each other)

- Add netcdf version (netcdf or netcdf-groundwater) detection to make
  plugin more robust

- Pinned threedigrid to working version (0.1.3)

- Animation tool: split nodes and lines into node_results, line_results,
  node_results_groundwater, line_results_groundwater (all with own styling)

- Add module base.netcdf_groundwater (relocated from base.DummyDataSourse)

- Fix find_h5_file

- Add (temporary) ad-hoc implementations of get_timeseries and
  get_values_by_timestemp_nr.

- Fix QGIS plugin updater problem on Windows with files being unable to be
  deleted because they're held open by QGIS.

- Fix cache clearer for groundwater.

- Fix incorrect 'q_lat' name.

- Set root logger level to make logging to QGIS work.

- Reproject gridadmin.sqlite to wgs84 (EPSG:4326): this fixes the side view
  tool that expects the generated layers to be in that projection.

- Add groundwater categories to styling.

- Combine nodes, flowlines and pumplines in one ``gridadmin.sqlite`` file.

- Add pumplines exporter.

- Add layer generation for ``netcdf-groundwater`` results.

- Add ``BaseDataSource`` abstract interface.

- Add h5py 2.7.0 to ``external`` libs for Windows. The files were acquired
  by installing h5py using OSGeo4W on Windows 7, and copying the installed
  files to the ``external`` folder.
- Add detection method to determine whether .h5 or id_mappping.json is present
  (this determines if the netcdf is old (no groundwater) or new (groundwater)


0.15 (2018-02-07)
-----------------

- Update lizard-connector, which contains a fix for mitigating problems with
  the ``future`` library that is used by QGIS.


0.14 (2017-11-14)
-----------------

- Fix bugs in the control structures.


0.13 (2017-10-23)
-----------------

- Update lizard-connector to 0.5 to fix the limit of 1000 results.

- Add tool "control structures".

- Remove unused code.


0.12 (2017-08-09)
-----------------

- Default maximum for QSpinBox is 99, so setValue is limited to 99. That's
  why the spinbox_search_distance maximum and spinbox_levee_distance are
  set to 5000.

- Add v2_orifice to the flowlines styling.

- Add ``v2_numerical_settings`` to the layer tree manager.

- Fix csv_join import in statistic scripts.

- Fix invalid characters in directory name in the scenario downloader.

- Fix bug in method that sets column sizes due to overwritten attribute.

- Fix bug with logout not stopping the thread and keep pulling in results.

- Add Lizard scenario result download functionality to the
  ``ThreeDiResultSelection`` tool. Some remarks about this feature:

  - To connect with the Lizard API, ``lizard-connector`` is used. Downloading
    the data happens in a worker thread because there can be many resuls.
    After logging in the user will be presented with the newest results
    immediately (this is synchronous). Progressively older results will be
    downloaded by the thread and dynamically added to the table view.

  - Chunked downloading (using append mode) is used because of the large
    files, which we do not want to keep in memory.

- Add tool "create breach locations".

- Automatically remove old entries from both the connected point and the
  calculation points table when the tool ``predict_calc_points`` is being
  re-run.

- Add a second connected point to the template for calculation points of type
  "double connected".

- [toolbox] rename 'toolbox_tools' to 'Tools', use english for toolbox
  sub-directories, remove 'Instellingen' tab, remove 'auto update logboek'
  checkbox.

- Fix ``guess_indicators.py`` tool.

- Fix clearing cache in Windows.

- Update documentation for stats module.


0.11.1 (2017-07-04)
-------------------

- Fix release that didn't include depencencies.

- Introduce hack in Makefile to fix missing depencencies.


0.11 (2017-07-03)
-----------------

- Remove checked in source code for SQLAlchemy, SpatialAlchemy
  (a.k.a. GeoAlchemy2), and PyQtGraph. These packages will now
  be installed with pip using a requirements.txt.

- Add class diagram documentation for ``ThreediDatabase``.


0.10 (2017-06-20)
-----------------

- Fix E501 (line too long) violations manually because AutoPEP8 can't fix
  those.

- Add pycodestyle checking to Travis.

- AutoPEP8 everything.

- Include model result files in repo + add more tests.

- Remove deprecated/unused code.

- Add QGIS as dependency to Travis; make nosetests work on Travis for all
  tests.

- Add a new tool (``CacheClearer``) to clear the model cache.

- Add an About tool class so that the about ``QAction`` can be added in the
  same way as the other tools.

- Add ``setup.cfg`` with coverage options (needs ``coverage``); exclude the
  external and importer source files from tests.


0.9.3 (2017-04-10)
------------------

- Changed array shape for lines array in Netcdf. This was done due to a bug in
  the calculationcore netcdf library.

- Add option to make graphs  ``absolute`` to the graph tool.

- Bugfix predict calcualtion points: For endpoints always enumerate the
  ``last_seq_id`` by one.

- Added QML styling for 2d schematisation.


0.9.2 (2017-02-14)
------------------

- Adopted the column names for the ``predict_calc_points`` command to the
  newest 3Di migrations.


0.9.1 (2016-12-12)
------------------

- Fix Travis build.

- Bugfix import sufhyd.

- Fix assertion in netCDF datasource and update QML styling.


0.9 (2016-11-28)
----------------

- Update cumulative aggregation methods.

- The user_ref field now has the following format:
  ``<content>.code#<content>.id#<table_name>#calc_pnt_nr``

- Uniform usage of ``spatialite`` instead of ``sqlite`` as ``db_type``
  variable string throughout the ThreediToolBox.

- Auto populate the ``levee_id`` column of the ``v2_connected_pnt`` table
  when a new point is being added or the location of an existing point is
  being changed.

- Auto populate the ``connected_pnt`` table from the computed calculation
  points that have a calculation type greater than 1.

- Sufhyd import:
  - logfile has same name and location as sufhyd, whith '.log' extended
  - added extra logging about used file, date adn number of objects
  - the multiple connection number (num_mvb) is added to connection codes
  - automatically add boundary when structures are not connected to end node
  - moved automatically added boundaries 1 meter

- Set required qgis version to 2.14

- Sideview:
  - bugfix: support of profiles without height (used for weirs)
  - correct relative heights for profiles which does not start at 0 height

- Bugfix: impervious surface, changed 'half_open' to 'open_paved'

- Bugfix: graph legend hover shows correct location when using 'result' layers

- support 'dry' cell values (without showing -9999 in graph)

- improved 1d modellayer styling

- Bug fix: Explicitly check for ``None`` on the return value of the
  ``calc_type_dict`` because a return value of 0 is also falsy.
  Also make sure the ``dist_calc_points`` attribute is always
  available for objects with a geometry

- Executing a select statement on an empty table using sqalchemy causes
  problems becasue it does not allow to cosume the active cursor.
  The cursor explictly has to be closed, or references to it dropped.
  Otherwise the cursor and thus the connection will be alive, and
  the database will be locked.

- Using the sqalchemy engine instead of the ``QtSql.QSqlQuery`` object
  to retrieve data from postgres or spatialite databases to make sure
  the geos extension is available (this doesn't always seem to be
  the case for windows installtions).

- Bugfix: Removed ``os.path.join`` to generate the ``db_name`` variable because
  this produced a '/' instead of a '\' for windows OS.


- Auto populate the ``connected_pnt`` table from the computed calculation
  points that have a calculation type greater than 1.

- Added the tool ``predict_calc_points``. It computes the threedicore
  calcualtion points and their calculation type.

0.8.2 (2016-09-22)
------------------

- Bugfix: layers not present in the ``styled_layers`` dict were added without
  stats, but should be added with stats.

- Sufhyd import: Fix for outlet constraints.

- Sufhyd import: Set autoincrement to max id number to prevent id errors
  (when id's are manually set)
- Slight improvement to the previous bugfix. The exact problem was with the
  pump layers which were not cloned. Now we clone them explicitly, so the
  previous bugfix isn't necessary anymore.

- Bugfix for segmentation fault when deleting the root layer group. The
  possible reason for the segfault is adding the same layer from the
  TimeseriesDatasourceModel to the QGIS map registry multiple times. The fix
  is to clone the layers so we don't get the same layers added multiple times.

- Updated the styler so that it doesn't apply styles to layers without the
  right statistic fields. If the layer doesn't have the right statistics, just
  show the layer without any styling.
- Bugfix relative path exception.

- Optimizations in getting the time array from netCDF.

- Refactored NetcdfDataSource and included support for getting all variables
  from both regular and aggregation netCDF including getting the timeseries.

- Removed support for spatialite datasource with results.

- Changed id behavior for netcdf datasources and requesting tools. Now the
  netcdf_id or spatialite id is used (so no magic with -1, etc.)

- Added ``water op straat`` statistic to manhole statistics; refactored NcStats
  a bit.
